# Distant supervision for medical entity recognition

Medical Entity Recognition (NER) with distant supervision methods for Norwegian. 
The underlying lexical resource is [NorMedTerm](https://github.com/ltgoslo/NorMedTerm), a list of Norwegian categorized medical entities. The resource is included in this repository. 

## Dependencies 

[ufal.udpipe](https://pypi.org/project/ufal.udpipe/)

## Lexical baseline

Baseline tagging relying on lexical match with terms from NorMedTerm. Performs optional pre-processing and statistical analysis of the tagged entities.
The 'examples' folder includes some example medical texts from [Legemiddelh√•ndboka](https://www.legemiddelhandboka.no/).

### Example runs

#### tagging and statistics for already tokenised files
- `python lex_baseline.py -i <input_folder> -a ts`

#### processing, tagging and statistics with a subset of entity categories

- `python lex_baseline.py -i <input_folder> -a pts -m <path_to_udpipe_model> -e CONDITION,PROCEDURE,SUBSTANCE`

#### help

- `python lex_baseline.py -h`

## Distantly supervised neural model 

Coming soon.
